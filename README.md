# Banwave Bot
A python discord bot that automatically bans all people who match given characters

This bot, which was written in python, will ban all people from a discord server that match your characters (words, just letters, anything really)
I couldn't find anything like this on the internet, so I decided to make it myself! (hope I can help some people out lol)

# How to setup:
- Install or download this repository
- Open banwavebot.py with a code editor
- Enter your server ID in "SERVER ID HERE", your channel ID in "CHANNEL ID HERE", your bot token in "BOT TOKEN HERE" and your characters the bot should look for in "CHARACTERS HERE"
- (invite the bot to the server if you havent already)
- Start the python file
- Go to the channel you want the ban messages to be displayed in and type `?members`

# Requirements:
You will need to install the following libraries with pip:
- discord
